Sure! Let's go through the steps to achieve the task using Kubernetes. We'll first create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), then a Pod that uses this PVC, and finally expand the PVC using `kubectl edit` or `kubectl patch`.

### Step 1: Create a PersistentVolumeClaim

First, create a YAML file for the PersistentVolumeClaim:

```yaml
# pvc.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pv-volume
spec:
  storageClassName: csi-hostpath-sc
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Mi
```

Apply this configuration using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
```

### Step 2: Create a Pod that uses the PersistentVolumeClaim

Next, create a YAML file for the Pod:

```yaml
# pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-server
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      name: html-volume
  volumes:
  - name: html-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pv-volume
```

Apply this configuration using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

### Step 3: Expand the PersistentVolumeClaim

Finally, expand the PersistentVolumeClaim to a capacity of 70Mi. You can do this using `kubectl edit` or `kubectl patch`.

#### Using `kubectl edit`:

```bash
kubectl edit pvc pv-volume
```

This command will open the PVC definition in your default text editor. Find the `resources.requests.storage` field and change it to `70Mi`. Save and close the editor.

#### Using `kubectl patch`:

```bash
kubectl patch pvc pv-volume -p '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "70Mi"}}}}'
```

### Step 4: Record the change

Kubernetes automatically records changes made via `kubectl patch`. If you used `kubectl edit`, you can add the `--record` flag to ensure the change is recorded:

```bash
kubectl edit pvc pv-volume --record
```

Or for `kubectl patch`:

```bash
kubectl patch pvc pv-volume -p '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "70Mi"}}}}' --record
```

### Summary of Commands

Here are all the commands in sequence for easy reference:

```bash
# Apply the PersistentVolumeClaim
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml

# Apply the Pod
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml

# Expand the PVC using kubectl edit
kubectl edit pvc pv-volume --record

# Or expand the PVC using kubectl patch
kubectl patch pvc pv-volume -p '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "70Mi"}}}}' --record
```

This should create the necessary resources and expand the PVC as required.

### Story: Setting Up a Storehouse and a Delivery Truck

Imagine you are running a small business where you need a storehouse to keep your goods and a delivery truck to distribute them. Here’s how the process would work:

#### Step 1: Reserving a Space in the Storehouse

First, you need to reserve some space in a storehouse to store your goods. You tell the storehouse manager that you need a small section, say 10 cubic meters, and that you will only access this space one at a time (just like a single person can use it at a time). This is like creating a "PersistentVolumeClaim" (PVC) in IT.

#### Step 2: Getting a Delivery Truck

Next, you need a delivery truck to move your goods from the storehouse to your customers. You get a truck (which we'll name "web-server") that’s designed to carry these goods. The truck is equipped with an area to load goods from the storehouse. This is like creating a "Pod" in IT that uses the space you reserved in the storehouse.

#### Step 3: Ensuring Fair Usage of Resources

You don't want your delivery truck to be too small or too big. If it's too small, it might not carry enough goods. If it's too big, it might take up too much space on the road, blocking other vehicles. So, you set rules that the truck should be able to carry at least a certain minimum amount of goods (let's say 64 units) but no more than a maximum (say 128 units). This ensures it operates efficiently and doesn't affect others. In IT, this is like setting resource "limits" and "requests" for the Pod, ensuring it has enough but not too much memory and CPU.

#### Step 4: Expanding the Storehouse Space

As your business grows, you realize you need more space in the storehouse. So, you contact the storehouse manager again and request to expand your reserved space from 10 cubic meters to 70 cubic meters. You make sure this change is officially recorded so everyone knows about the new space allocation. This is like expanding the PVC in IT and recording the change.

### How This Relates to IT

1. **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: Think of it as reserving space in a storehouse.
    - You create a space reservation called `pv-volume` with a storage class `csi-hostpath-sc` and a capacity of 10Mi (10 cubic meters).

2. **Pod**: Think of it as getting a delivery truck.
    - You create a truck named `web-server` that uses the reserved space to load goods. The truck is equipped with specific space (`/usr/share/nginx/html`) to place the goods (similar to mounting the volume).

3. **Resource Limits**: Ensuring fair usage of resources.
    - You set the minimum and maximum load the truck can carry (memory and CPU limits) to ensure it operates efficiently without hogging resources.

4. **Expanding PVC**: Increasing storehouse space.
    - You request to increase the reserved storehouse space from 10Mi to 70Mi and ensure the change is recorded.

By following these steps, you ensure that your business (or your IT system) runs smoothly, with enough space for storage and a properly sized truck for delivery, while also being able to grow when needed.
